Antidepressants that are not metabolised by CYP2C19 - or to a lesser extent - include, for example, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine. If it is not possible to avoid clomipramine: monitor the effect and side effects or the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine. For obsessive compulsive disorder, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is greater than 200 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine that is as low as possible. For anxiety disorders, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is approximately 100 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine lower than 200 ng/mL. A sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine exceeding 600 ng/mL is considered toxic. Add a low dose of fluvoxamine if necessary, to inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 and thereby inhibit the conversion of clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine. Indication DEPRESSION: no action required</p>\n"

The gene variation has little to no effect on the plasma concentration of clomipramine+desmethylclomipramine, which determines the efficacy for depression and side effects."
