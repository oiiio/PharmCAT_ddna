Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring. Adjustment of the dose should then be based on therapeutic drug monitoring.\nFor example: A Dutch study found a median trough concentration for tacrolimus of 14.7 ng/mL after 3 days at an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg twice daily for 29 kidney transplant patients who were heterozygous expressers. Their target value was 10 - 15 ng/mL.</p>\n"
