Individuals who have biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in CACNA1S generally will have autosomal recessive myopathies and should be managed according to the standard of care for those disorders. Although some may, indeed, have susceptibility to anesthetic agents, the recommendations described here cannot adequately address such patients, and they should be managed by a physician who is knowledgeable regarding those disorders.</p>\n"
